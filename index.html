        Humans of Centre College (HoCC) is a student-led photojournalism organization that aims to discover and
        spread the stories of our community here at Centre. With our small team of photographers and interviewers,
        we seek out students, professors, and staff with interesting stoires that we all feel should be shared 
        with our community! We do not limit ourselves to just those with great accomplishments or flashy 
        narratives- every story is worth sharing and everyone should have a chance of being a Human.
        <br /><br />
        Each year our community expands with new people and new stories that need to be shared. Although each 
        member of our team is constantly seeking out new candidates for our stories, we know that we can't 
        find every Human on our own. If you have any suggestions for a new Human you would like to see interviewed,
        please feel free to use the link above to contact one of us!
