## Humans of Centre College Website

### Created by Mark Hisle, Class of 2020

## Documentation
 
 This website was designed for the Humans of Centre College club in the year 2019. The club's purpose is to find and tell the stories of
 the diverse members of our college's community. Each individual we interview thus becomes a new addition to our collection of the lives
 of regular "Humans".
 
 The current design covers basic information about the club not readily available without sifting through our social media pages, along
 with the highly important link to the "Suggest a Human" google form.
 
 The website was made using the Jekyll site generator/layout, Sass, and Bootstrap 3, Any questions on website design should be 
 presented to Mark Hisle '20 (mark.hisle@centre.edu), original creator of the site.

 This may or may not be exported to the actual Centre College website in the future, or will remain a side-project
 for the club. There is no licensing of any kind for this code until a further decision has been made on the scope of the site.
